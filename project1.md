Dijkstra Algorithm for GPS Graph
================================

-   **Class: Algorithms (CSCI 415)** 
-   **Grade: A** 
-   **Language(s): C++** 
-   **Source Code Repository:** [mdstargel/dijkstra-algorithm-project](https://github.com/mdstargel/dijkstra-algorithm-project)  
    (Please [email me](mailto:mdstargel@csustudent.net?subject=GitHub%20Access%20-%20Dijkstra%20Project) to request access.)

## Project description

- This is a Dijkstra Algorithm program to solve a GPS problem. It reads inputs from a text file and finds the distance from a start vertex to the rest of the vertecies in an adjacent matrix. The value of an entry represents the distance between two vertices. The format of the text file will be: Vertex, Vertex, Distance. Then it outputs a chart of the minimum distances using the Dijkstra Algorithm from that vertex to the rest in a chart on the console.

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
g++ 
```

If the programming language does not require compilation, the update the heading to be “How to run the program.” If your application is deployed on a remote service, including instructions on how to deploy it.

## 3. Additional Considerations

- The pdf intructions say to only output the one chart, my code outputs all of the charts from all the start vertecies.
