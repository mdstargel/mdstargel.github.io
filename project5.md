## Project description

This program creates a UDP server side and client side terminal able to send or receive files over the same network. By sending the file over from the server side, it sends and outputs the file on the client side named the same thing. It will not work if the document doesnâ€™t exist.

## How to compile and run the program

Compile and Run (in two seperate terminals):
```bash
g++ udpTestServer.cpp && ./udpTestServer.out
```

```bash
g++ udpTestClient.cpp && ./udpTestClient.out
```

## UI Design

The user can set up a server with a listening port to receive a file. The client enters the server port, server IP address, and the name of the file he/she wishes to send. If the file does not exist an error message will be shown.

## 3. Additional Considerations

- The program outputs the part files as they are being sent or received to both terminals.
