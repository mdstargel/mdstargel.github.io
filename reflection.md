Self-Reflection Questions
================================

## Discuss one challenge you overcame during your academic development. What was the challenge, was it technical, nontechnical, or both, and how did you overcome it?

- In my academic development, I have encountered many challenges. The biggest challenge however was the academics itself. It is no secret that computer science is a difficult field. I struggled in mainly three classes due to technical problems (no understanding material) and nontechnical issues (internal struggles). In order to overcome the painstaking process of learning the material and passing the classes, I had to retake them and ask for extensions over two Christmas breaks which required long and intensive hours working on assignments. Though I may not have the highest technical knowledge or be the most skilled in this field, I used my strong work ethic and determination to eventually prevail in those classes. As a result, I was behind academically and again did what was necessary though it was less than ideal and took four classes over a summer break to correct my academic trajectory. As far as internal challenges, I sought counseling and tried to improve internal and external habits to help with my mental and emotional health.

## Discuss a situation where you worked with a team. How would you describe yourself as a teammate? Where can you improve your team skills? Be specific.

-	For a class project, four others and myself were responsible for designing a website. Again, I wasn’t the best at programming but I pitched in where I could which ended up being documentation, flow charts, diagrams and the like. I am certainly a team player and I will sacrifice for the good of the team. I am eager to learn whatever needs to be done to pull my weight. However, I definitely can improve my time management in order to dedicate more time to team projects. My technical knowledge could increase which would allow me to be more versatile in the areas to which I can contribute. 

## What type of career in CS do you believe you are most suited for? Why this field and not another? Be specific.

-	I believe I am best suited for a manager position in the CS career field. As I’ve stated above, I do not have the best technical skills nor the highest technical knowledge to be a great programmer/developer. However, I have a solid base line understanding so I am not completely lost. I am a very good planner, I’ve learned to delegate fairly well due to military experience, and I am a very interpersonal individual so I am able to build relationships and communicate well with the more technical level employees. This allows me to create the big picture plans and bridge the gap in communication from low level technical speak to high level, broad, layman’s terms to those above me in the chain of command. 

## What professional organizations would you like to join? What professional development would you like to be a part of in the next five years? Be specific and don't consider places of employment.

-	Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), IEEE Computer Society, and Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) all sound interesting. I’d like to contribute to something tangible that makes a difference in people’s everyday lives. I am going straight into the military and will be there for at least four years, so for corporate professional development I don’t foresee many opportunities arising other than potentially earning a master’s degree within that time. There are numerous opportunities within the USAF for professional development (schooling, training, certifications, etc.) of which I would like to take advantage.

## What are the ways you can use the skills you have learned in CS to serve your community? Be specific.

-	Critical thinking and problem solving is going to be vital in the military. If I pursue computer science after separating from the military, I would like to use my technical knowledge to assist a Christian company or ministry in some way. Whether that be by developing software, managing an IT department, or simply running media I’d like to use the skills I’ve learned to expands the Lord’s kingdom. There is a ministry called Life Action I would enjoy working for.
